# What
`main` branch permissions are set to only allow changes to it via pull requests.
# Why
Several important reasons for this:
1. Enables code review, which can help identify potential bugs, improve code quality and ensure adherence to coding standards
2. Provides a space for discussion, collaboration and sharing knowledge about the codebase and newly introduced features
