# Context
As of January 2025 I have worked as a software engineering technical delivery lead (also known as a project lead) for around 8 years. There are certain management or delivery practices that have proven to be beneficial in the teams that I have worked on, all driving towards the goal of efficient and sustainable software delivery.
# Purpose
The repository aims to document delivery practices, the prerequisites needed to facilitate them and the goals that they contribute towards.
# Plan
The long-term plan is to create a comprehensive reference for all aspects of technical delivery that matter to me and have seen to provide long-term benefits for the teams and products that embrace them.

Short term plan:
1. Structure the repository as an Obsidian vault with interconnected markdown files.
2. Provide examples of practices where possible.
3. Enable cloning and usage of this repository for any current or future engagements to quickly assess the situation and plan for reaching efficient and sustainable software delivery.
# Structure
Each file under the `Toolkit` folder is of one of the following types:
1. [[Dependencies]] - things out of your direct control, for e.g. obtaining access to a client's GitHub repositories
2. [[Work]] - things that are in your direct or in-direct control, for e.g. setting up a code repository to prevent merging to `main` branch without a pull request
3. [[Practices]] - methodologies, processes and techniques that drive towards efficient and effective software delivery, for e.g. maintain a green `main` branch build
4. [[Goals]] - high level objectives that practices contribute towards, for e.g. Continuous Integration
